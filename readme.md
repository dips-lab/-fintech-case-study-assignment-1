## Insuretech ![Test Image 1](https://thefintechtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1174059640.jpg)

Insurtech refers to the use of technology innovations designed to squeeze out savings and efficiency from the current insurance industry model. Insurtech is a combination of the words “insurance” and “technology,” inspired by the term fintech.

The belief driving insurtech companies and investments by venture capitalists in the space is that the insurance industry is ripe for innovation and disruption. Insurtech is exploring avenues that large insurance firms have less incentive to exploit, such as offering ultra-customized policies, social insurance, and using new streams of data from Internet-enabled devices to dynamically price premiums according to observed behavior. Companies in insurtech domain are looking to tackle data and analysis issue head-on. Using inputs from all manners of smart devices, including GPS tracking of cars to the activity trackers on our wrists, these companies are building more finely delineated groupings of risk, allowing products to be priced more competitively.

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
** Given current unprecedented situation in the health care market due to pandemic outbreak at international level, League Inc. can use their data in a very safe manner to create partnership with health care providers to plan and predict the resource requirement. At this time, Canada is facing heavy shortages of Vaccines and medications. In collaborations with pharmaceutical industries and employers, who are willing to pay extra for generating favourable and safe work environment, League Inc can design vaccine delivery network. It can also collaborate with government agencies and University health network to predict number of doctors and caregivers required in particular health risk domain based on their data collected from individual user. ![Test image](https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2020/10/bigstock-coronavirus-vaccine-357620810-580x387.jpg)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
** Given how data driven the company tends to be and their user experience and product delivery system depends on accurate prediction of the data: more and diverse data availability can safeguard company’s risk analysis on the trends of product where they would like to offer health care products. 
** The company will develop intrinsic data-sets in collaboration with the government and University health network, which can provide them strong customer base in coming time. 
** Company can provide the data based on per use pay to different pharma companies under stringent confidentiality agreement, where they can generate positive cash flow and pay for their repository and digital expense. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
** I think company is already using, AI for data based predictions, IoT to collect and generate point to point data and Blockchain for encrypted and incremental data saving and data sharing. I believe, these technologies in combination with legally acceptable, digital end user agreement to protect data breaches at every level can provide a safeguard for any future litigations and anti-competition action.
